                        My immediate interests within Computer Science shifts according to classes, personal projects, and my ever changing professional goals. Initially, like most of my peers, I applied to the major in the hopes of learning to make video games. However, since high school, my eyes have been opened to the scope of the field. As I dig deeper into the curriculum, I have cultured a fascination with subjects such as User Interface, Data Management, and Algorithm Implementation to name a few. There are tons of opportunities for innovation and making a positive impact in society outside of pure entertainment. My goals are constantly evolving and I find myself drawn to new and exciting challenges within the field. I am constantly learning and growing as a student.

                        Most summer jobs have been relatively mundane. However, I was lucky enough in 2021 to teach as a STEM Summer Camp Instructor for children ages 4-12 at Idea Lab Kids.  Each class lasted only 1 week, but every camper left with a project and far more comfort using computers. When I was not teaching, I was doing rapid and relentless troubleshooting with any one of the 16 kids in a typical class. Many of the younger kids had not even used TV remotes. So they would be taught how to use computers and build a simple Roblox game in the <a href="https://create.roblox.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Roblox Studio</a> level designer.
                        Older kids tended to be touch more tech-savvy. We designed a simple Minecraft mod which introduced them to programming basics and project management.
